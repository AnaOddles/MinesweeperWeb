These minesweeper icons were recreated from Microsoft Minesweeper 
	for Windows XP by Charles R. Davis during the Fall 2020 semester.
	
The images were then resized from 10px:10px to 50px:50px during the 
	Spring 2021 semester for cst247.
	
Please accredit me for the recreation of these images in your project
	if you use them.
